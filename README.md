# Quiz
Quiz game built with OOP in mind. At first the project was created using functional methodology and reworked to OOP standarts. You can find functional JS in functional.js file and OOP logic in app.js file.

Project is built using HTML, SCSS and ES6 JS. I also used local storage to keep track of the scoreboard.
